# N.A.V.I---Frontend
This is the frontend implementation for the mobile app Navigation Assistance for Visually Impaired people. 


Installation:
1.	Install APK file on your mobile phone
2.	Activate your phoneâ€™s native Screen Reader via Accessibility Setting, this step is crucial as the app interacts with the screen reader directly

Note: your mobile device and the device hosting the back-end must be on the same local network, the front-end communicates with the back-end through an API that is hosted on localhost:5000. Ensure that the port is available.
